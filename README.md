# Ajokit

This is a simple traffic simulation written in JavaScript.

**NOTE: This project is old. It was created mainly for fun and learning purposes. If I wrote this project today, I would do some things differently (most importantly use modules). Still, the code works (for the most part), so hopefully you find it useful if you are interested in creating your own simulation app.**

# Setup

```bash
npm install grunt-cli -g
npm install bower -g

npm install
bower install

grunt 
```

Create a web server and point it to serve files from *dist* folder.
